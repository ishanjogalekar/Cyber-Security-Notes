## Hacking:-

Hacking is a method to find computer data and use it for breaching defences and exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network.
Basically, there are different techniques in hacking to find weaknesses in computer security.
It is mainly related to cybersecurity.
Bypass limitation on product or software ( like applying the patch on software and use it aspirated) is also considered a form of hacking.

## Information Security :-

Information security is a field that deals with being protected against
unauthorized usage of information especially from aspects of technology. It relies on its three principles that must be sustained.
1.Confidentiality
2.Availability
3.Integrity

## Cyber Security:-

Cybersecurity deals specifically with defending, security system & network against cyber attacks.
In world cybersecurity, the term usually associated with obtaining unauthorized access to the remote or local system.
Cybersecurity is divided into two main parts :

üü¶Defensive side:- Blue team

üü•Offensive side:- Red team

## Responsibility Distributions :

‚≠ï **Red team**: Security experts responsible for 
                                     **a. Active investigations 
                                       b.Probing of the system** 
                     Also for 
                                  **a. Bench Test     b.Tests on live system**

üîµ **Blue team** :  Composed of InfoSec + Cybersecurity experts
                                    Deal with -
                                             a. Defending systems by changing with settings.
                                             b. Configuring & Maintaining security measures on the perimeter and outside.

üü£ **Purple team**: Not officially belong to any team but deals with works of red & blue team both.


## Types of Hackers :
 ‚¨ú **White Hat** :
Ethical hackers.
Experts in compromising the computer.
Use their ability for a good purpose.


 ‚¨õ **Black Hat** :
Illegal hackers.
Violate system for personal gain like money, power, politics, revenge or causing damage.
Operate on their own or in small groups.
Black hat hackers' activities are mostly criminal & illegal.

üé± **Grey Hat** :
Between Black hat & white hat hackers.
Sometimes hacking for good purpose and legal.
But mostly works as underground groups and commit some criminal activity.
**So, always hack as ethical and with permission**

## üß† Hackers - State of Mind:-
The basic thought that there is always " WAY IN " for any software, database and any other system.
Hackers are seeking challenges, competitive & constantly developing, changing their techniques for hacking.
Hacker needs to find only 1 flow or error, loophole.


## üéûTerminology:-

1. **Vulnerability** :
A security flow that attacker can exploit to gain access into network, system or application.

2. **Exploit** :
Implementation of vulnerability in the form of code or POC ( proof of concept) that can be used to achieve the goal of remote access, the privilege of escalation etc.

3. **Threat** :
The possible danger that asset might be compromised due to breach & cause harm to the system.

4. **Malware** :
Piece of software that carries a payload that can exploit a vulnerability within the system & perform different actions on-site and software.

5. **Virus** :
The virus is a type of malicious software that when it is executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs & inserting its own program in another program of the system.
eg: Virus infecting other files in computer modifying them and deleting them etc.

6. **Worm** :
A computer worm is a type of malware that spreads copies of itself from one computer to another also through the network, it does not need to attach itself to any software or need to be executed by the user. It automatically starts affecting the system once get downloaded or pushed into the system.  It mainly causes lesser damage than viruses.

7. **Trojan** :
Software that usually arrives from email or pushed to users when they visited infected websites. A trojan is like a covered malicious program with some normal working program. Trojan must be executed by the victim & typically provide remote access to the attacker.

8. **Ransomware** :
Type of malware programs that encrypts the system's data & holds it hostage waiting for cryptocurrency or any other payment.

9. **Scareware** :
For malware that uses social engineering that tricks users to believe their computer is infected with fictional malware & suggest fake malicious software as a solution.

## üìÖ Attacks Nowadays:-
Despite modern improvements in security, attack statistics keep growing.


300 + attacks in the US in 2015 ÓÇà 16.
About 1 link in every 13 URLs on the web is a malicious link.
Recent attacks :
1. New vulnerabilities on both old & new software.
2. There is usually a time window between when a vulnerability is discovered until getting patched.
3. 1 / 3 computers facing some security issues even though vulnerability is patched before.
4. Facebook data leak about 533 million accounts.
https://haveibeenpwned.com/:  Website to check your data is leaked publicly or not.

## üìÄ Data Breaches:-

Not all attacks brought to public knowledge.
The main idea behind this is to get victims name, emails, passwords etc.


## ‚ñ∂ Common Attack Flow:-

Reconnaissance ‚Üí Weaponization & Delivery ‚Üí Exploitation & Installation ‚Üí
Escalation & Spreading ‚Üí Remote actions

## Attack Domains:-

Applications: Through websites Infrastructure & Hardware
Password attacks: Using Remote keylogger
Mobile phones
IoT devices hacking to create data breaches.
System hacking, changing OS preferences.
Hacking emails on other social media platforms.

## üíªMainly used OS for Hacking :

üëå **Kali Linux**: Debian based, many tools, most used
                                 Link: https://www.kali.org/

üî• **Parrot OS**: Debian based, more customizable, less configured than kali
                                 Link: https://www.parrotsec.org/

Mostly these OS installed in a virtual environment

üî∑**Virtual box**: Most used, advance, free
                                     Link: https://www.virtualbox.org/

üï∂**VMware**:Commonly used with MAC PC, mostly free but some features paid
